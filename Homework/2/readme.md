**1.**


 a = 1:         assigns a as the integer 1

 b = 'x':    assigns b as the character x

 c = true: assigns c as the logical 1

 whos a b c:   displays a table of values for the variables a-c

 a == c: compares a to c to determine equality; true

 a + c: adds a and c together; assigns to ans variable

 d = [1 2 3 4]: assigns d as a single row, four column matrix with the integers 1-4

 e = ['a' 'b' 'c' 'd']: assigns e as a single row, four column matrix with the characters a-d

 f = ['abcd']:   assigns f as a string of four characters

 g = {‘a’ ‘b’ ‘c’ ‘d’}: assigns g as a cell

 h = { a b c d}:   assigns h as a cell

 whos d e f g h:  displays a table of values for the variables d-h
